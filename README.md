# MY DASHBOARD FOR CRCS PORTAL
The proposed dashboard provides a comprehensive view of society data, focusing on key aspects such as the distribution of societies across states, the prevalence of sector types, society registrations over time, and the area of operation based on sector type. The dashboard aims to offer users an interactive and visually appealing experience while analyzing the data.

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
1. Societies across States: This map visualization highlights the geographical distribution of societies across different states. Users can easily identify the states with the highest concentration of societies and observe any regional patterns.

2. Sector Types across States: The bar chart illustrates the distribution of sector types within each state. This allows users to compare the proportion of different sectors across states and identify the predominant sector types in specific regions.

3. Distribution of Sector Types: The pie chart provides an overview of the distribution of sector types across all registered societies. Users can quickly grasp the relative prevalence of each sector type and gain insights into the overall sector composition.

4. Societies Registered over Time: The line chart presents the trend of society registrations over time. This visualization enables users to identify any fluctuations, growth patterns, or trends in society registrations.

5. Area of Operation of Society by Sector Type: The stacked bar chart showcases the area of operation segmented into four splits, and within each split, displays the distribution of sector types. Users can assess the prevalence of sector types within each split of the area of operation and gain insights into the specific sector focus of societies operating in different areas.

Based on the information gathered, we can derive some key insights:
i) Maharashtra emerges as the state with the highest number of societies, totalling 28. This suggests a significant level of economic and social activity within the state.
ii) The states of Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh prominently feature Agro sector types, implying that these regions have a significant focus on agricultural activities.
iii) The pie chart analysis reveals that Agro sector types dominate the majority, with a count of 52. Cooperative Banks follow with 11, and Health/Hospital sector types with 9. This suggests that Agro is the most prevalent sector type among the analyzed categories.
iv) The dominance of Agro sector types across multiple states indicates the importance of agriculture as a key economic driver in those regions. This could be due to factors such as favourable climate, availability of resources, and agricultural expertise.
v) The chart demonstrates substantial growth in the Agro sector type from 2017 to 2022. This signifies significant expansion and development within the agricultural sector during this period.
vi) Furthermore, the chart also highlights a gradual growth in the Health/Hospital sector type specifically from 2021 to 2022. This could be due to factors such as population growth, increased health awareness, or improved access to medical facilities.
vii) Finally, the visualization indicates that Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan are the primary areas of operation for a majority of societies, totalling 15. This suggests a concentrated presence and focus of societies in these regions.

These insights provide a glimpse into the trends, patterns, and characteristics revealed by the visualizations and data analyzed.

The dashboard offers interactive features such as data highlighting and filtering. When users select specific data points or segments from the visualizations, the dashboard highlights related data, enabling users to focus on specific details. Additionally, checkboxes provide filtering options, allowing users to slice the data according to their preferences.

Furthermore, to enhance user experience, the dashboard incorporates a toggle button that allows users to switch between dark and light themes, catering to individual preferences and optimizing readability.

Overall, this dashboard for the CRCS portal can empower users to gain a comprehensive understanding of society data, make informed decisions, and extract meaningful insights to support their objectives.
